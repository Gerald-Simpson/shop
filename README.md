## Custom ecommerce site with CMS for a small business

This project is a current work in progress and a live version of the main fork can be viewed [here](gerald-simpson.com).

The main focus of this project was to hone the integration of frontend and backend skills I acquired through freeCodeCamp courses.

In addition, the project aimed to develop a simple, custom, ecommerce site. This site would offer the flexibility for customers to update content using a CMS, providing an alternative to selling on Etsy while minimizing monthly expenses.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
  - Following the deprecation of Create-React-App, I chose Next.js because of my interest in it's server-side rendering and directory-based routing, along with it's extensive adoption.
- Tailwind CSS
  - Tailwind integrated well with Next.js, enabling styling to be conveniently managed alongside other code.
- MongoDB
  - Given the project's limited scope, I saw no need to introduce complexity with an SQL-based database, thus opted for MongoDB.
- Stripe
  - Stripe appeared to provide a straightforward integration at an affordable price point for payment processing.
- CMS (TBD)
- Authentication (TBD)
